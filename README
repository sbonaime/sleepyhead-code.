*Warning*: Backup your SleepyHeadData directory before using this branch or start a new profile

SleepyHead is cross platform, opensource sleep tracking program for reviewing CPAP and Oximetry data, 
which are devices used in the treatment of Sleep Disorders like Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

SleepyHead is written by Mark Watkins (aka Jedimark), an Australian software developer afflicted with sleep apnea.

SleepyHead is copyright (C) 2011-2018 Mark Watkins <mark@jedimark.net>

Requirements:
-------------
Qt5.9 SDK with webkit (Qt5.9 from http://qt.io/download-open-source recommended, and please ONLY use that if you wish to submit bug reports)
Linux needs libudev-dev for qserialport to compile

OSX needs Xcode and commandline tools from AppStore,

Windows needs MinGW (in Qt5 SDK) or VC++2015 Community, and a matching set of Qt libraries.

Building:
--------

Recommend shadow building to not cruft up the source code folder:

cd ..
mkdir build_sleepyhead
cd build_sleepyhead
qmake ../sleepyhead-code/SleepyHeadQT.pro 
make

You may need to add a -spec option to qmake to suit your platform. 
Adding -j4 speeds up the make command on a dual core or greater system.

Building on OSX:
---------------
Build as above. If qmake fails with the error:
Project ERROR: Xcode not set up properly. You may need to confirm the license agreement by running /usr/bin/xcodebuild
edit the file: 
QT_INSTALL_DIR/5.9/clang_64/mkspecs/features/mac/default_pre.prf

and replace
/usr/bin/xcrun -find xcrun 2>/dev/null

with
/usr/bin/xcrun -find xcodebuild 2>/dev/null

Redistribution of derivatives
-----------------------------
I created this software to help lessen the exploitation of others. Seeing my work being used to exploit others 
is incredibly un-motivational, and incredibly disrespectful of all the work I put into this project.

If you plan on reselling any derivatives of SleepyHead, I specifically request that you give due credit and 
link back, mentioning clearly in your advertising material, software installer and about screens that your 
derivative "is based on the free and open-source software SleepyHead available from http://sleepyhead.jedimark.net, 
developed and copyright by Mark Watkins (C) 2011-<current year>."

It is not enough to reference that your derivative "is based on GPL software".
